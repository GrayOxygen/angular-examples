Angular JS Common
===========================

A collection of useful directives, filters, and services for Angular JS.

## Install

```
bower install angular-common
```

## Suggestions 
For new suggestions please create an issue so I can keep track of all suggestions.

## Repo TODO
- Ensure compatibility with bower.
- Write tests for all directives, services, and filters.
- Add a list of dependencies.
- Create a build script to minify files. (Should this rely on a grunt task?)

## Directives TODO
- Slugify
- Autoresize
- Preprocess image upload
- Stripe
- Mediaelement
- Timeago
